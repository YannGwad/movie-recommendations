# movie-recommendations

Analysis of movie data and movie recommendations based on the IMDb database.

The first part of the project was aimed to exploring, and cleaning the IMDb database in order to scope the analysis on the European cinema.
Visualisations, and figures were created on Plotly, Matplotlib.

The second part was the creation of a web app for a cinema owner that displays movie information and recommendations of similar movies based on
european niche (cf. screenshots below). It builds on the K-Nearest Neightbours algorithm to recommend movies based on similar features (eg. genre, release date, popularity).

This work is a group project led at Wild Code School (Oct-Nov 2021).
